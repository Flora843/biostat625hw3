\usage{
LRM(formula, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{The same object of class "formula" as the origin R function lm(): a symbolic description of the model to be fitted.}

\item{data}{an optional data frame, list containing the variables in the model. If not found in data, the variables are taken from environment(formula), typically the environment from which lm_s is called.}
}
\value{
The function returns the Coefficients' matrix which contain the value, S.E, t-statistics and p-value of each coefficient. The function also will automatically print summary of coefficients and anova table of the model.
}
\description{
The LRMdev function will fit a linear model using given data set. It will automatically print summary of coefficients and anova table of the model.
The function can treat NA with different action.
The function may not treat interaction terms correctly and cannot fit a model without an intercept properly.

\examples{
y = rnorm(1000)
x = rnorm(1000)
z = rnorm(1000)
